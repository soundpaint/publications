Supporting Gregorian neumes in music notation software requires formal
modelling of music representation, as storage format and as input
language.  Since neumes notation differs significantly from subsequent
music notation, we give a short historical survey and explore a
concept for musically adequate modelling based on the Solesmes monks'
19th century research and more recent findings, including composition
of ligatures from basic neumes, and compare it with different
approaches.
